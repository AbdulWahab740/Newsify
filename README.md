## üåü Features
- **Personalized News Feed:** Tailored to your interests.

- **Efficient Search:** Find exactly what you're looking for with a powerful, fast, and accurate search.

- **Summarized Articles:** Get the key takeaways of a story at a glance.

- **Ad-Free Experience:** Focus on the content, not the clutter.

## üíª How It Works:

Newsify operates through a series of intelligent steps to deliver a superior news experience.

- **Extraction:** The system continuously extracts the latest news from various sources using an external API.

- **Vectorization & Storage:** Each news article is processed and converted into a numerical representation (vector) and stored in a specialized vector database. This approach allows for rapid and semantic similarity-based searching.

- **Advanced Retrieval:** To ensure you get the most relevant and unique results, Newsify employs a sophisticated retrieval pipeline:

- **Hybrid Search:** This method combines the strengths of both keyword and semantic search. It's like having the best of both worlds: you can find articles based on specific terms (like "AI" or "Tesla") while also discovering articles that are conceptually related, even if they don't use the exact keywords.

- **Re-ranking:** After the initial search, a re-ranking model evaluates the retrieved articles to prioritize those that are most relevant to your query. This step ensures that the best results rise to the top.

- **Deduplication:** The system identifies and removes duplicate or near-duplicate articles from the search results, ensuring you don't see the same story multiple times from different sources.
